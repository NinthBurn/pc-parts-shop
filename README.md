# Administration Panel for PC Parts Store
A web application for a computer parts shop. Front-end was written in React using MUI component library and React Router, while the back-end is using a RESTful API written in Spring Boot. For the database, I have chosen to use MongoDB. 

With the current configuration, the database is stored locally, as I was unable to connect to the MongoDB Atlas cluster they offer for free.

# Features
* Pretty user interface, making use of MUI library and its components
* Ability to add, update or delete any entity
* A live statistics page, displaying information about the products: category diversity, brand diversity, etc.
* A page for each product
* Pagination, with page caching on the client
* Sorting based on any property of the objects

# To-do
~~* Migrate sorting, filtering & pagination to the back-end~~
* Make a detailed page for each product ( description, image(s?) )
